### Adding New Extensions

We're always looking for useful extensions! When adding new extensions:

1. **Ensure it's pure Dart** - No Flutter dependencies
2. **Make it generally useful** - The extension should benefit a wide range of use cases
3. **Follow existing patterns** - Look at how similar extensions are implemented
4. **Add comprehensive documentation** - Include dartdoc comments with examples
5. **Write tests** - All new extensions must have test coverage

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Dart SDK 3.7.0 or higher
- Git

   ```

5. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   dart test
   dart analyze
   ```

## Pull Request Process

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, concise code
   - Add or update tests as needed
   - Update documentation

3. **Run tests and linting**
   ```bash
   dart test
   dart format .
   dart analyze --fatal-warnings .
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format:
     - `feat: add new string extension for palindrome checking`
     - `fix: correct datetime age calculation`
     - `docs: update README with new examples`
     - `test: add tests for map extensions`

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe your changes in detail
   - Include examples of how to use new features

7. **Address review feedback**
   - Be responsive to comments and suggestions
   - Make requested changes promptly
   - Push updates to the same branch

## Style Guidelines

### Dart Code Style

- **Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)**
- **Use `dart format`** to automatically format your code
- **Keep functions focused** - Each function should do one thing well
- **Avoid overly complex expressions** - Break down complex logic into smaller parts
- **Use meaningful names** - Variable and function names should be descriptive

### Documentation Style

- **Use dartdoc comments** for all public APIs
- **Include examples** in documentation
- **Be concise but complete** - Explain what, why, and how
- **Use proper grammar** and punctuation

Example:
```dart
/// Converts the string to camelCase.
///
/// Removes special characters, splits on spaces/underscores/hyphens,
/// and capitalizes each word except the first.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// 'hello world'.camelCase; // 'helloWorld'
/// 'user_name'.camelCase; // 'userName'
/// ```
String get camelCase => ...
```

### File Organization

- **One extension per logical grouping** - Keep related extensions together
- **Use part files** for extensions under `lib/src/extensions/`
- **Export publicly** from `lib/mayr_dart_extensions.dart`

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- **Test all public APIs** - Every extension should have tests
- **Test edge cases** - Empty strings, null values, boundary conditions
- **Use descriptive test names** - Test names should describe what is being tested
- **Organize tests by extension type** - Mirror the structure of the lib/ directory

Example:
```dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import 'package:mayr_dart_extensions/mayr_dart_extensions.dart';

void main() {
  group('StringCasingExtensions', () {
    test('camelCase converts string correctly', () {
      expect('hello world'.camelCase, equals('helloWorld'));
      expect('user_name'.camelCase, equals('userName'));
      expect(''.camelCase, equals(''));
    });

    test('camelCase handles edge cases', () {
      expect('a'.camelCase, equals('a'));
      expect('HELLO WORLD'.camelCase, equals('helloWorld'));
    });
  });
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dart test

# Run specific test file
dart test test/extensions/string_test.dart

# Run with coverage
dart test --coverage=coverage
dart pub global activate coverage
dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info --report-on=lib
```
